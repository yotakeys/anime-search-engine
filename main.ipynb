This may sound like I'm placing the series on a pedestal, and you could say that personal bias has influenced by decision to rate MIA a full 10/10 for all the components, but please allow me to try my best to break down and pinpoint just exactly why it has earned such a place in my heart.  \\r\\n \\r\\nBeginning with the first episode, which took me by serious surprise when I was left in absolute awe by the mystical vibes exuded by the astounding visuals and the beautiful soundtrack. MIA has one of the best first episodes I have ever seen thus far because unlike other shows where they bombard the audience with a complex plot in a desperate attempt to bait them into watching the rest of the show, MIA does that exact opposite. Instead, we tag along with our protagonist, Riko, and her adventures down into the abyss. Some things occur, and right off the bat, episode one was sufficient to leave me tense at the edge of my seat, yet the premise is simple and digestible enough for me to follow along. And at the end, we are treated with a stunning picturesque overview of the abyss, and that alone was enough to leave me desiring to be transported into their world and explore the abyss along with Riko. They had successfully pulled off their intended effect – to reproduce that sort of charm and mystery of the abyss, something that is so dangerous, slightly sinister, yet people, both the characters in MIA, along with the audience, are drawn to it.  \\r\\n \\r\\nMoving on to the crux of MIA, the plot. The first few episodes mask the true sinister reality of the show and I was tricked into thinking this would be a cute adventure series with Riko and friends, but boy does that completely change in the next few episodes to come. Now don’t get me wrong, being ‘dark’ or ‘deep’ doesn’t necessarily equate to a good compelling story, as plenty of shows that seek to achieve such an effect often go beyond their capacity and all that remains is simply a cringefest of wasted potential. Yet, MIA absolutely nails in its execution. Even in earlier parts where there was a lighter more upbeat tone, the story never got stale and it was just downright entertaining to witness the happenings and adventures of Riko and those around her. And now that I think about it, it wasn’t really the plot itself that was unique or fantastic, rather, it's the perfect pacing and storytelling the series chose to adopt that really sold the show to me. I would go so far as to say that MIA is somewhat like a deconstruction of adventure genres and how behind the excitement and thrill of going on a journey of never return, lies the harsh brutal reality, something that even 12 years olds are not immune to, and are in fact more prone to its effects due to their fragility.  \\r\\n \\r\\nI could not have asked for a better two main characters, Riko and Reg. One is an enthusiastic fearless adventurer and the other a shy yet fiercely protective friend. This iconic pair are extremely well written characters that spoke out to me on a profound level, weaving my emotional attachment towards them, and thus cue the tears and heartache when misfortune befell them. The complement and supplement each other in so many ways that it is just really darn endearing to see them interact. And due to spoiler reasons, I shall not delve deep into the third main character that only appears in the later episodes, but she, too, is absolutely precious and I honestly cherish the chemistry and relationships that they foster over the span of the series. Even side characters, including the most minor ones, and even ones that don’t even appear apart from through flashbacks and recollections, are memorable and they have that sense of quirkiness and originality that is in its own way a breath of fresh air after so many reused anime troupes that we have seen time and time again.  \\r\\n \\r\\nEvery single Friday for 13 weeks, this show was something that I really looked forward to. It was a spectacular journey and one that I am so happy I decided to start. It is absolutely magical and a feast for my eyes as with such a unique art style accompanied with the most detailed backgrounds. Every piece of music matched the scene so well and it was truly a beautiful symphony of sounds, visuals and storytelling. Thank you for reading my review of this Masterpiece and I hope that you will embark on the same journey as me and finish it with the same feelings as I did. :)  \\r\\n\\n\\n          \\n \\n       Helpful \\n   \\n      \""

       "'Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira, Synopsis, Another day, another bounty—such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop. However, this routine is interrupted when Faye, who is chasing a fairly worthless target on Mars, witnesses an oil tanker suddenly explode, causing mass hysteria. As casualties mount due to a strange disease spreading through the smoke from the blast, a whopping three hundred million woolong price is placed on the head of the supposed perpetrator. With lives at stake and a solution to their money problems in sight, the Bebop crew springs into action. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Edward, followed closely by Ein, split up to pursue different leads across Alba City. Through their individual investigations, they discover a cover-up scheme involving a pharmaceutical company, revealing a plot that reaches much further than the ragtag team of bounty hunters could have realized. [Written by MAL Rewrite], Genre Action, Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi, Space, Sep 1, 2001, with 1 Episodes, Score 8.4,  more pics Overall 8 Story 7 Animation 9 Sound 8 Character 9 Enjoyment 8 This movie does a lot of things right. It introduces the characters from the show and establishes their personalities without seeming tedious to the ones who have already seen the show its based on, and it showcases the tone right from the opening scene; kind of serious (in a pulpy, kick-butt way) with some moments of levity. Its really difficult to write about this completely separately from its preceding TV show, but it gives the same cool, jazzy vibes while still being fresh, and they do a great job at translating a Cowboy Bebop story into the length of a film while keeping the shenanigans youd see in a typical episode of the show sprinkled throughout. Its fun, engaging, and just really neat. That being said, if you havent seen the show, it really is as good as everyone says it is. Plus, it establishes and develops these characters in ways you wont see in the movie. Definitely check it out. Helpful more pics Overall 8 Story 8 Animation 9 Sound 9 Character 8 Enjoyment 9 It had everything I love about the series - good music, wonderful characterizations and dialogue, beautiful art. More impressively, the fight scenes were fantastic, the tension beautiful and the plot nicely spaced and plotted. Cool new characters too. Excellent. Helpful more pics Overall 7 Story 0 Animation 0 Sound 0 Character 0 Enjoyment 0 The movie, “Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira” is designed to fit between episodes 23 and 24 of the television series - and it fits there well. It’s good to see an episode allowed to fill a movie length time slot instead of the 24 minute slots designed for commercial broadcast. The characters are more fleshed out with more and longer action sequences. Edward gets to show off her hacker chops and the recurring three old men even get a significant moment in the spotlight. The animation is pretty much the same as the series but the script has more depth with a better story that has time to develop. If you’re expecting “Cowboy Bebop: The Movie” to be something other than a movie length episode from the series, then you might be disappointed. But if you’re looking for a slice of the series that you can sink your teeth into with more complexity, action, mystery and a chance for the cast to show their stuff, then you’re gonna like this film. Helpful more pics Overall 5 Story 7 Animation 9 Sound 8 Character 2 Enjoyment 6 Cowboy Bebop: The Movie/Cowboy bebop: Tengoku no Tobira is a film by Shinichirō Watanabe, and a great reference to highlight the faults of television film adaptations. Cowboy Bebop: The Movie falls into the common pitfall of feature film television adaptations. It essentially takes what could have been a 24 minute episode of the original show, and stretches it into a 2 hour film. This results in severe pacing issues and an excessive amount of narrative padding. This alone would be enough to severely weaken a film, but Cowboy Bebop: The Movies problems stretch beyond that. Pretentious, pseudo-philosophical dialogue and a terribly weak supporting cast result in a film with a frankly crippled story that wouldve been better left untold. The plot itself is fairly solid on paper. Its fairly cohesive and easy to follow. The first act starts off well, with the main cast going through the motions and setting the tone of the film to mirror that of the TV show. However by the second act, it becomes very obvious that it wasnt written with 2 hours of storytelling in mind, and this is the fundamental reason why the film doesnt work. In order to fill the two hour run-time, the second act is padded with unnecessary scenes of exposition. Worse still is that much of the same information is reiterated over and over multiple times. When you arent watching Jet get spoon-fed information, youre watching Spike get spoon-fed the same information instead. This results in a very dull 2nd act, which unfortunately has repercussions on the third act. The acti'"
